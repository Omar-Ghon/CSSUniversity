This is a university website made using exclusively HTML and CSS, with 4 lines of JS. 
It's a solid emulation but can be added to in the future more pages, logos, and responsive buttons.
This serves as a good foundation to add scripts later to make it a fully functioning website.

To launch the website:
Open in VSCode, download the 'Live Server' extension by Ritwick Dey, then 'Go Live' from the bottom right.
The university navigation bar can be accessed by hovering over the header/clicking on it as indicated by the arrow on the right.
